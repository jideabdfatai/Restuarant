# ResturantOpeningHours

# although the json object works well but it could be better by making it much simpler 

 "thursday": [
 {
 "type": "open_hours",
 "openhour": 36000,
 "closehour":65800
 }
 ],
 
 personally i think this should be in the format above. as this will save excution time and also server resources.
